# -Project-on-predicting-a-realtion-between-BMI-and-Body-Fat-and-related-variables
The objective of this project is to find out the relationships between ‘Body Fat Percentage’ and the 'Body Mass Index' that we will be calculating during the analysis. This is a comprehensive dataset that lists the estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men. This dataset was taken from http://staff.pubhealth.ku.dk/~tag/Teaching/share/data/Bodyfat.html. It was generally supplied by Dr. A. Garth Fisher who gave the authorization to freely distribute the data. The main goal of the project will be to determine a relation between body fat and BMI and to conclude which is a better measure. The goal for this project is to find the relation between 'Body Fat Percentage' and other predictors as well as 'Body Mass Index' and others. We will be creating a new feature(variable) named BMI.
